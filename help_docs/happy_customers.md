### Case Study:

> **HubSpot**:

In addition to using SeleniumBase for testing the UI of their content management system, HubSpot used SeleniumBase to automate the migration of website pages from their old CMS to their new one, which saved them over one million USD and a significant amount of time.

Learn how HubSpot uses SeleniumBase for website testing by reading: [Automated Testing with Selenium](https://dev.hubspot.com/blog/bid/88880/Automated-Integration-Testing-with-Selenium-at-HubSpot#hs_cos_wrapper_name)

### How is this list generated?

Most of these rows come from [LinkedIn search results](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?keywords=seleniumbase&origin=SWITCH_SEARCH_VERTICAL) of profile descriptions, where employees mentioned that they have used SeleniumBase at their company. These details may also be found in other public networks and social media sites, such as GitHub (where organizations could have public repos that use SeleniumBase).
